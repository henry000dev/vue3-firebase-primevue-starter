# vue3-firebase-primevue-starter

This is a starter template for the Vue 3, Firebase and PrimeVue stack.

## Firebase
To use, a Firebase project needs to be setup first. Then a web app needs to be created. Copy its configuration to the Firebase `config.js` file.

For this starter template, the Firebase email authentication mechanism is implemented. It is ready to use right after the Firebase side is setup.

## PrimeVue
The UI components are based on PrimeVue. PrimeFlex and Prime Icons are also used in the front end.

The theme is modified from one of PrimeVue's Material Design light themes. See [this post here](https://henryko.dev/2021/07/11/getting-started-with-primevue/) for how to customise PrimeVue theme.
